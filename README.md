by Mohammed Rahman

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about making whatever with Javascript to solve a problem that is common in the real world. The purpose of this blog is to go over my process of making my Freedom Project.

## Content
For my project, I am making a platformer game. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Phaser in order to make a short and functional game.

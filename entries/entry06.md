# Entry 6
##### 6/3/22

Alright so for Blog 6, I will be talking about my takeaways from giving my SEP Expo Elevator pitch and giving my in-class presentation. 

So for my Expo Elevator pitch, I have gotten a 3/4 for creativity. I think that this is a fair score because the skeleton of my game was based on a template from phaser. However, I did create my own map and functionality to make my game different and fun. I think that I shouldnâ€™t use too much from a template in the future. I have gotten a 3.5/4 for usability which is alright because my project was fairly easy to use. I also got a 3.5/4 on the presentation, which is something I need to work on because I was stuttering a bit. I was good at improvising on my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1omB2xLnXmOLe5X6pkbqtUQXCdxEmrjhpzNPAyekhReA/edit) when I was forgetting a line. I think that my energy was good because I was loud and kept eye contact with the judges.

So for my [In-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GEhPFFlKL_zbTAsp9ShE3a7bV6uX-AbAswB6oJ_igus/edit#slide=id.g12e499b969c_1_32347), I got a 2/2 on the hook and visuals. I did well on these because I made my hook and visuals appealing to the audience since I asked a question, and it had the people engaged. And my visuals looked good because of the slide template I used. I should stay using hooks like the one I used for this presentation. I got a 1/2 on the conclusion, and I understand why because I did not summarize my presentation. Next time I should either dedicate a slide as a summary or have a summary in my script. 

For the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp), I am on 7 and 8. I say this because I am talking about how I can improve on my project and presentation. And I talked about the result that came with the project. I can also actually use my own advice to develop my game further which would knock me to stage 7.

[Skills](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) I developed from this was communication and creativity. I developed communication by talking with my classmates to see what they thought about my game and what I should do to make my game a bit more interesting. I also developed my creativity skills by making a new hook that no one else thought of, asking a question, and having the audience answer it.

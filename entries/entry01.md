Alright, so for this blog entry, I will be talking about my thought process on what tool I chose for the freedom project and why I chose it. Also will be talking about what I want to achieve with this tool I have chosen.

First off, I looked through Mr. Mueller’s Freedom Project Tools List and browsed through the medium fire difficulty tools. I looked at the one’s with “Game Engine” tagged on them. So I picked 3 of the game engines. Which are:

* [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
* [Impact](https://impactjs.com/)
* [Matter](https://brm.io/matter-js/)

So after looking through these tools, I have decided that I want to use Phaser. I chose this game engine because it is the engine that can help me create the game I want. When I was looking through [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/), I found an example game page that helped me envision its similarities to the game I want to make. The example game I looked at was called [StarStruck](https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/starstruck). It had the 2D world that I envision for my game. I am going to make a platform game just like Mario.

So for the [Engineering design process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp), I am on the 2rd stage. I am here because I have defined what type of game I want to make, which is a platformer. And have done the 2nd stage because I have researched which game engine I want to work with, which is Phaser. Looking at the future for the Engineering design process, for stage 3, I will have to brainstorm what type of backgrounds and textures I want for my game. I will also have to Brainstorm ideas on where I should get my help on coding from, like youtube or websites.

Alright, so for the end of my blog, I will be talking about the skills I have had to use. The [Skills](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) I used were consideration and how to read. I used consideration by considering the fact that we didn’t have too much time to make a game, so I should be focusing on a game that is pretty fast to make since it is only me making this game, not a whole organization making a game like minecraft. I also considered making a game that everyone would like to play since people have preferences. For “How to Read”, I looked through the example game’s code on phaser and found that they use stuff like variables and functions, like we do in class.

Okay, so for this blog I will be answering the question, how have I been learning my tool? Also, what is my goal for winter break?

I have been learning phaser with this website called [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-phaser). It has lessons for phaser, which was given to me from Mr.Mueller on slack, phaser channel. I have done some lessons on this website. An example of a lesson that was taught was how to create a circle and place with the axis, size and color.

```js
let circle1 = this.add.circle(300, 400, 10, 0x9F00D0);
```
* 300 = x-axis
* 400 = y-axis
* 10 = radius of circle for size
* 0x9F00D0 = color of the circle

My goal for the winter break is to keep working through these lessons. I would say, around 2 lessons because I want to chill on the break. I also want to look through [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/), to find more games that I can take inspiration from. 

For the Engineering Design process, I would say that I am still on stage 2 because I am still researching ways I can use phaser. By researching, I am basically saying that I am looking for the tools that can help me best learn my tool. For the next stage, which is stage 3, I brainstorm which areas of the game I can use the knowledge I have gained from the websites that helped me learn phaser. Also from what I said on blog 1, I can brainstorm the game’s texture and color.

Alright, to end this blog, I will be talking about the  [Skills](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) I have had to use. I had to use, “how to read” because codecademy had me reading the information like how we read the information on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript). Another skill that I used was attention to detail because I was carefully examining the chances that were occurring to the circle in the codecademy lesson.
